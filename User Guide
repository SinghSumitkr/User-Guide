1. Overview of the New Interface
The new Qlik Sense dashboard has been redesigned to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. It features a vertical flow, with information presented in a logical sequence from summary to detail. Users can quickly find what they need without jumping between different screens or tabs.

Key Changes:
Vertical Flow: A new layout where users scroll down to access more detailed information.
Aesthetic Improvements: Enhanced visuals for a better user experience.
2. Global Filters and KPIs
At the top of the dashboard, you will find the Global Filters. These filters apply to the entire dashboard, allowing you to refine the data according to your needs. Below the filters are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), presented in bold fonts to give you a quick snapshot of product performance.

Global Filters: Located at the top; they impact the entire dashboard.
KPIs: Displayed below the filters; provide high-level insights at a glance.
3. Summarized Visualizations
On the main dashboard view, you will see a collection of summarized visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and combo charts. These visualizations offer a concise overview of the product’s performance and help you understand trends quickly.

Visualizations: Include pie charts, bar charts, and combo charts.
Purpose: To provide a summarized view of the data for quick insights.
4. Local Filters and Chart Management
Below some visualizations, you will find Local Filters. These filters are designed to manage specific charts rather than the entire dashboard. For example, the Periodicity Filter allows you to toggle between quarterly, yearly, and monthly trends for a specific combo chart.

Local Filters: Focused filters for specific visualizations.
Example: Periodicity Filter to manage quarterly, yearly, and monthly trends.
5. Vertical Scrolling Navigation
The new interface emphasizes a vertical flow, allowing users to scroll down to access different sections of the dashboard. This layout makes it easier to navigate from summary information to more detailed data without needing to jump between different views.

Vertical Scrolling: Simply scroll down to access more detailed information.
Benefit: A continuous flow of information for seamless analysis.
6. Tabular Data and Self-Service Reporting
As you scroll further, you’ll come across tabular data views like straight tables and pivot tables. For users who prefer more control over their data analysis, we have included Self-Service Reporting capabilities within the same flow.

Tabular Data: Straight tables and pivot tables for detailed information.
Self-Service Reporting: Customize dimensions and measures for deeper analysis.
How to Use Self-Service Reporting:
Scroll to the Self-Service Reporting section.
Select your dimensions and measures from the available options.
Use the available buttons to add or remove selections as needed.
7. Search Functionality
To help you find specific dimensions or measures quickly, the dashboard includes a Search Functionality. Simply type in part of the name or even a guess, and the relevant options will appear. For those who prefer voice commands, you can even speak the name to find what you’re looking for.

Search Bar: Type or speak the name of the dimension or measure you need.
Benefit: Saves time and improves efficiency in locating specific data points.
8. Current Selection Ribbon
The Current Selection Ribbon is a streamlined feature that allows you to see all your active filters and selections. Located at the top of the dashboard, this ribbon floats above your view, giving you quick access to your selections without cluttering the interface.

Location: Floating at the top of the dashboard.
Function: Displays active filters and selections in a sleek format.
Global Search, Undo, and Redo Features
Located on the Current Selection Ribbon, in the top-left corner, you will find icons for Global Search, Undo, and Redo. These features are designed to enhance user navigation and improve the overall experience:

Global Search: Empowers users to search any data value from the entire dashboard. It performs a wild search, listing out all possible fields and related data values.
Undo and Redo: Allow users to go back and forth with their selections. This is especially useful when experimenting with different filters and need to revert to previous states or reapply certain selections.
