I am excited to apply for the position of Data Management Lead - Metrics Visualization Developer within the AI/ML & Data Platform team at JPMorgan Chase. With over 14 years of experience in data visualization, business intelligence, and data management, coupled with my role as a Senior Associate at JPMorgan Chase, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the firm's mission of delivering high-quality, scalable data-driven decision-making solutions.

In my current role, I have led the development and optimization of high-performance dashboards and reports, driving user engagement by 20% and reducing report generation times by 85%. My experience in setting up frameworks for standardized dashboard testing, validation, and code reviews has decreased production issues by 70%, significantly improving stakeholder confidence in the solutions we deliver. Additionally, I have successfully migrated QlikView dashboards to Qlik Sense, working on both front-end UI migration and backend data source transitions to AWS Athena and Aurora DB.

I have a proven track record of collaborating with stakeholders to understand and meet reporting requirements. My experience working with large, complex data sets and performing statistical analysis aligns well with the responsibilities of developing and maintaining a firm-wide metrics reporting platform. I also bring a solid foundation in Qlik, SQL, and data visualization technologies such as HTML and CSS, as well as experience in Alteryx, which I used to develop interim reporting solutions.

In this role, I am eager to leverage my expertise in data visualization, automation, and metrics reporting to support the Chief Data Analytics Office and other key stakeholders in delivering actionable insights. My background in leading agile teams, fostering collaboration, and implementing process improvements will be instrumental in driving the development of innovative data solutions that meet business needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to continue my career at JPMorgan Chase and contribute to the success of the AI/ML & Data Platform team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can support your goals.
