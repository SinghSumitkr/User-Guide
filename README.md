When you first open the dashboard, you'll notice that all the filters are conveniently located at the very top of the screen. These filters are categorized into four distinct types to provide flexibility and clarity when analyzing data:

Dropdown Filters:

These filters display a dropdown list of all distinct values under a specific column when clicked.
You can select one or multiple values from the list, allowing you to apply multiple selections at once.
Radio Button Filters:

These filters are designed for exclusive selection. They allow you to choose either Option A or Option B under a specific field but not both.
These filters are represented as radio buttons to clearly signify that only one option can be selected at a time.
Calendar Filters:

Calendar filters such as Year, Quarter, and Month display all possible values directly in front of you.
Similar to the dropdown filters, you can select multiple values at a time, enabling easy customization of the data range for your analysis.
Advanced Date Filters:

The advanced calendar filter has been redesigned to enhance user experience. Upon clicking this filter, you will see two distinct date segments: From Date (left) and To Date (right). This allows for precise selection of a date range.
There are two methods to select dates:
Manual Entry: At the very top of the calendar, you can manually type the desired dates.
Calendar View Selection: Select the Year and Month to bring up a calendar layout, where you can then pick your specific dates.
Filter Header Information
For added convenience, if you select any value within a dropdown filter, the filter header will display helpful information:

Number of Selections: Shows the count of selected values out of the total available distinct values for that filter.
Horizontal Status Bar: This bar uses three colors to represent different statuses:
Green: Indicates the total number of selected values.
White: Shows the total number of associated (available) values within that filter.
Grey: Represents the total number of unassociated values (those that do not match the current selection criteria).
This intuitive display allows you to quickly understand your selections and filter states without having to open the filter. It provides a clear overview of what is selected, what is still available, and what is excluded.
