The Clear All Selections option is located to the right of the Step Back and Step Forward icons in the Selections Bar. This feature allows users to quickly reset their selections within the dashboard.

Key Features
Clear All Selections: Clicking on this button clears all current selections made in the dashboard, providing a fresh state for new analysis.
Locked Selections: Note that selections that are locked will not be cleared. Only unlocked selections are affected by this action.
This tool is particularly useful when you want to start a new data exploration without manually deselecting each filter or selection made earlier.
