Bookmarking Selections
When analyzing data, you may come across specific insights you'd like to revisit or share with others. Bookmarks allow you to save the current selection state of a sheet, making it easy to return to or share a particular analysis.

Bookmarks save both the selections and the sheet location, which can later be restored to a previous state. All bookmark tools can be accessed via the toolbar.

Default Bookmark
A default bookmark allows you to set a specific sheet as the landing page of your app. If no default bookmark is set, the app overview is displayed when the app is opened.

Key Points to Consider:

You can only set one default bookmark for an app.
Clearing the selection of the default bookmark while viewing a sheet is possible, but the bookmark will be reapplied when the sheet is reloaded or reopened.
If the app is open in another tab during an active session, the default bookmark will not override selections made in that other tab.
