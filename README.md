Self-Service Reporting: Advanced Data Analysis Capabilities
The Self-Service Reporting section is a powerful feature of this dashboard designed to facilitate deep data analysis. Users can access this section by scrolling to the bottom of the dashboard. This advanced functionality offers a range of features that enable users to customize their data views, perform detailed analyses, and gain deeper insights. Here's a breakdown of the key features of the Self-Service Reporting:

Selection of Dimensions and Measures:

In the Self-Service Reporting section, users can easily select the dimensions and measures they wish to analyze. On the left side of the Self-Service Reporting panel, all dimensions are listed under the "Dimensions" heading, while measures are listed under the "Measures" heading, just below the dimensions.
Upon selecting a dimension and measure, the data appears dynamically in the data segment.
Switch Between Tabular and Pivot Views:

Users can switch between tabular and pivot table views by clicking the visualization option at the top-left corner of the Self-Service Reporting area. This option dynamically changes based on the current visualization. If the table view is displayed, a pivot icon will appear, and vice versa.
Another way to change the visualization type is by hovering over the "Table" label in the top strip. Here, users will find options to switch the visualization type, choose an automatic visualization, or remove the option from the strip.
Interactive Top Strip for Dimension and Measure Control:

The top strip in the Self-Service Reporting section displays all selected dimensions and measures, allowing users to rearrange their positions and adjust column placements.
This strip also includes a Search option, enabling users to quickly find and select dimensions. If unsure of the exact name, users can type partial names or wild guesses to see matching options.
On the right side of the strip, there are two important icons: a Clear All icon (cross) to clear all selections, and a Voice Selection icon (microphone) to select dimensions by voice input. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with a long list of dimensions, saving time otherwise spent scrolling.
Dynamic Data Customization:

The data displayed in the Self-Service Reporting section is user-driven and dynamic. Users select the information they want to see, and the data updates accordingly. This flexibility allows for custom analysis without any predefined settings.
Filter Options for Each Dimension:

Each dimension in the Self-Service Reporting section has an associated filter icon. By clicking this icon, users can turn the dimension into a filter and select specific values to filter the entire dashboard. This is particularly helpful when a dimension is not included in the global filters but is needed for analysis.
Similar filtering options are available directly from the top strip, where dimensions and measures are listed. Hovering over a selected dimension will reveal filter options, sorting options, and enable/disable options.
Sorting and Enable/Disable Options:

Users can sort the data by selecting the sorting option available in the strip, regardless of whether itâ€™s in a tabular or pivot view.
The enable/disable option allows users to remove a dimension or measure from the data view without removing it from the strip.
Remove Selections with Ease:

The strip also provides a quick way to remove specific dimensions or measures. Each entry has a cross icon; clicking it removes the dimension or measure from both the strip and the data segment.
There are separate Clear buttons for dimensions and measures, allowing users to clear all dimensions or measures independently without affecting the other.
Dimension and Measure Section Control:

For users who prefer to focus solely on the data segment, there is an option to hide the Dimension and Measure sections. This can be done by clicking the "<" icon located between the Dimension-Measure segment and the data segment, providing a wider screen for detailed data analysis.
Impact on the Rest of the Dashboard:

It is important to note that selecting dimensions or measures in the Self-Service Reporting section does not affect other parts of the dashboard. However, selecting a specific data point within a dimension will reflect across the entire dashboard.
The Self-Service Reporting section brings advanced flexibility and control to users, making it an indispensable tool for anyone looking to perform comprehensive and customized data analysis.
