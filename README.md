1. Overview of the New Interface
The new Qlik Sense dashboard has been redesigned to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. It features a vertical flow, with information presented in a logical sequence from summary to detail. Users can quickly find what they need without jumping between different screens or tabs.

Key Changes:
Vertical Flow: A new layout where users scroll down to access more detailed information.
Aesthetic Improvements: Enhanced visuals for a better user experience.
2. Global Filters and KPIs
At the top of the dashboard, you will find the Global Filters. These filters apply to the entire dashboard, allowing you to refine the data according to your needs. Below the filters are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), presented in bold fonts to give you a quick snapshot of product performance.

Global Filters: Located at the top; they impact the entire dashboard.
KPIs: Displayed below the filters; provide high-level insights at a glance.
3. Summarized Visualizations
On the main dashboard view, you will see a collection of summarized visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and combo charts. These visualizations offer a concise overview of the productâ€™s performance and help you understand trends quickly.

Visualizations: Include pie charts, bar charts, and combo charts.
Purpose: To provide a summarized view of the data for quick insights.
4. Local Filters and Chart Management
Below some visualizations, you will find Local Filters. These filters are designed to manage specific charts rather than the entire dashboard. For example, the Periodicity Filter allows you to toggle between quarterly, yearly, and monthly trends for a specific combo chart.

Local Filters: Focused filters for specific visualizations.
Example: Periodicity Filter to manage quarterly, yearly, and monthly trends.
5. Vertical Scrolling Navigation
The new interface emphasizes a vertical flow, allowing users to scroll down to access different sections of the dashboard. This layout makes it easier to navigate from summary information to more detailed data without needing to jump between different views.

Vertical Scrolling: Simply scroll down to access more detailed information.
Benefit: A continuous flow of information for seamless analysis.
6. Tabular Data and Self-Service Reporting
As you scroll further, youâ€™ll come across tabular data views like straight tables and pivot tables. For users who prefer more control over their data analysis, we have included Self-Service Reporting capabilities within the same flow.

Tabular Data: Straight tables and pivot tables for detailed information.
Self-Service Reporting: Customize dimensions and measures for deeper analysis.
How to Use Self-Service Reporting:
Scroll to the Self-Service Reporting section.
Select your dimensions and measures from the available options.
Use the available buttons to add or remove selections as needed.
7. Self-Service Reporting Search and Selection Features
The Search Functionality in Self-Service Reporting allows users to search for dimensions within the Dimension List. This can be done in two places:

At the top of the Dimension List.
In the section just above the data section.
Simply type a few characters, and it will suggest all matching dimensions to your input. Additionally, there is a Voice Selection Option at the top-right corner of the Self-Service Reporting segment. You can speak the dimension name to find it.

Near the voice search icon is the Clear-All icon, which clears all selections made in the Self-Service Reporting. If you want to clear only selected dimensions or measures, look for the cross (X) icon in the top-right area of either the Dimension or Measure sections.

Dimension List as Filters:
All dimensions in the Dimension List work as filters, whether they are part of the global or local filters or not. Simply find the filter icon in front of the dimension name, and you will have a list of all values in that column for selection. Think of this as a consolidated list of all possible filters in one place.
Selected Dimensions and Measures:
Every selected dimension and measure will appear in the top horizontal strip within the Self-Service Reporting area where the search option is available. You can change their placement left or right, or delete them by clicking the "X" mark. For dimensions, you can filter data directly by hovering over the field and clicking the filter icon. Another option, "On or Off," allows you to remove a field from the Self-Service Report but keep it in the strip.
Data Representation Options:
You can switch between Tabular and Pivot data representations by clicking the top-left corner of the Self-Service area or by selecting "Table" or "Pivot Table" in the strip. Hover over these options, and it will give you an option to change the representation.
Column Management and Search:
Both data representations allow column management. In Tabular, you can move columns left or right, while in Pivot, you can move columns as in Excel.
Both representations also allow you to search within dimension columns, functioning as a filtering feature.
Sorting and Show/Hide Options:
In the Tabular representation, you can sort the data by clicking twice on a column.
The Self-Service Reporting segment allows you to show or hide the Dimension and Measure sections, providing a wider screen to view the actual data. Look for the icon with "<" between the Dimension/Measure section and the data section.
8. Current Selection Ribbon
The Current Selection Ribbon is a streamlined feature that allows you to see all your active filters and selections. Located at the top of the dashboard, this ribbon floats above your view, giving you quick access to your selections without cluttering the interface.

Location: Floating at the top of the dashboard.
Function: Displays active filters and selections in a sleek format.
Global Search, Undo, Redo, and Clear All Features
Located on the Current Selection Ribbon, you will find icons for Global Search, Undo, Redo, and Clear All:

Global Search: Empowers users to search any data value from the entire dashboard. It performs a wild search, listing out all possible fields and related data values.
Undo and Redo: Allow users to go back and forth with their selections.
Clear All: This icon will clear all selections made in the dashboard across all charts and graphs. To revert this action, use the Undo button.
9. Calendar Filter Enhancement
The Calendar Filter has been revamped to offer a more flexible date selection:

Clicking on the calendar filter will display two segments of datesâ€”From Date (left) and To Date (right). This allows you to select a date range for analysis.
You can either manually enter the date at the top of the calendar or select the year and month to choose your desired dates from a calendar view.
10. General Qlik Sense UI Features
Smart Search: Allows users to search across all data dimensions and measures in the app, providing a quick way to find relevant insights.
Responsive Design: Automatically adjusts the layout based on the device or screen size, ensuring a consistent user experience.
Bookmarking: Save specific states of the dashboard (filters, selections) for quick access later.
Snapshots and Stories: Take snapshots of visualizations and create guided stories to share insights with others.
Export Options: Export data and visualizations in various formats such as PDF, Excel, and images for offline use or reporting.
