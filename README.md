Step Back / Step Forward
The Step Back and Step Forward options in Qlik Sense are available to the right of the Smart Search icon in the Selections Bar. These options allow users to navigate through their selection history within the dashboard.

Key Features
Step Back: Reverts to the previous selection state in your current session. This can be used repeatedly to move back through all previous selections, all the way to the first selection made in the session.
Step Forward: Moves forward in the selection history, allowing you to return to a more recent state after stepping back.
Additional Information
The Step Back functionality works even if a selection has been locked. You can still step back to a state before that selection was made.
These tools are especially useful for iterative data exploration, where users may need to experiment with various selections and then revert to previous states without manually reapplying each selection.
Utilize the Step Back and Step Forward options to enhance your data exploration experience by effortlessly navigating through different states of your analysis.
